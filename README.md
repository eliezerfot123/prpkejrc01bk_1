# qaroni

## Docker Quickstart

This app can be run completely using `Docker` and `docker compose`. **Using Docker is recommended, as it guarantees the application is run using compatible versions of Python and Node**.

There are three main services:

To run the development version of the app

```bash
docker compose up flask-dev
```

To run the production version of the app

```bash
docker compose up flask-prod
```

The list of `environment:` variables in the `docker compose.yml` file takes precedence over any variables specified in `.env`.

To run any commands using the `Flask CLI`

```bash
docker compose run --rm manage <<COMMAND>>
```

Therefore, to initialize a database you would run

```bash
docker compose run --rm manage db init
docker compose run --rm manage db migrate
docker compose run --rm manage db upgrade
```

A docker volume `node-modules` is created to store NPM packages and is reused across the dev and prod versions of the application. For the purposes of DB testing with `sqlite`, the file `dev.db` is mounted to all containers. This volume mount should be removed from `docker compose.yml` if a production DB server is used.

Go to `http://localhost:8080`. You will see a pretty welcome screen.

### Running locally

Run the following commands to bootstrap your environment if you are unable to run the application using Docker

preview install and configure your db, for example linux;
```bash
createdb qaroni -O youruser

```

configure your file .env as .env.example and add your configurate for email and db

now configure your enviroment

```bash
cd qaroni
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
flas run
```

Go to `http://localhost:5000`. You will see a pretty welcome screen.

#### Database Initialization (locally)

Once you have installed your DBMS, run the following to create your app's
database tables and perform the initial migration

```bash
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```
